# On Stereoviews

Stereoview popularity soared around the turn-of-the-century, resulting in what is considered to be the first populist mass-media \[1\]. Hundreds of thousands of these stereoviews have been digitized. However, without a stereoscope (or equivalent) they remain out of reach for stereoscopic scholarship.
